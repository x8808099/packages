mountainsort3.mlp:
The mountainsort pipeline to use when generating command_sort (terminal command for sorting)

spec.cpp:
Just a copy of the sorting script inside the mountainsort3.mlp, so that we can view it directly.
The "param" listed there can be passed through the command_sort.
If not specified, the default values there will be used.
